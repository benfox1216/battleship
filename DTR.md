Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
-Talking through problems instead of messaging.
-Ping Pong (test-implementation).
-Try them all out to see what we like.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:


Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
Ben - Set status on slack if driving, otherwise respond that I can't help because driving
Cassie - Set working times are 7a - 8p (hard stop @ 8...7 days/wk)
Cassie/Ben - At Turing around 8a
Ben - Working times are generally 8a - 11p (7 days/wk)

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?
How will we make decisions as a team?):
1 - Touch base at least once per day after classes.
2 - Share ways to reach eachother.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
Cassie - Feedback from Flash Cards to be implemented (see: goals & expectations)
Ben - Enumerables are a weakness, knowing when to use them.
Both - Writing more fringe-case tests.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
TBD
50/50 workload split (as best as possible)

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
-Regular commits
-Code review on pull requests by partner before pushing to master
-Focus on this, in order to get the practice in for it.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
Giving - Empathetic w/ criticism, constructive w/ feedback.
Receiving - Be receptive, even if you disagree. Even disagreements are opportunities to learn for both.
